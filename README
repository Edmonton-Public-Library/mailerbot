Project Notes
-------------
Mailerbot is a project that emails customers messages. The script itself is 
simple: run on schedule and on wake-up check the working directory for pairs 
of files. Any file that ends in '.email' must have a list of user IDs (barcodes)
one per line. The file can be named anything like 'holds_no_purchase.email'. 
Mailerbot will then look for a matching file called 'holds_no_purchase.message' file
and send that message to the users listed in the 'holds_no_purchase.email' file.

If the names do not match no message is sent. Use '#' for comments in both 
message and user key file.

Internally the script will check each user key and report those it can email and
those it can not (because the user does not have an email address), and write 
those keys to 'fail' file, and change the name of the 'holds_no_purchase.key'
to 'holds_no_purchase.sent'. Clobber file if is exists.
