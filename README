Mailerbot is a perl script that emails customers customisable messages.

It will mail all the customers whose bar codes are listed in the input file -c.
It removes the customer bar codes found in -e (optional). The -e file is a 
black list, user IDs (or user keys) for customers that you don't want it to mail. 
This is useful if you want to set up a regular email job, but don't want customers
to be spammed each time it runs. Once the mailerbot is done, append the IDs 
from the -c list to the file that is the input for -e.

Mailerbot searches for customer emails and mails those it has addresses for
and prints those it can't to stdout.

Mailerbot can send custom messages to customers. Each line of the message must
appear between '|' characters in the -c file like so:
21221012345678|On April 30 you borrowed 'Room with a view'.|We found the case and not the disk.|

You can set a subject line for the mail you are sending by starting a line anywhere in the file
with 'subject:' like so:
subject: Missing items

You can also add a footer as a signature i.e.:
footer: Signed, your friends at EPL.

The output message in the above examples would look like
--snip--
    Subject: Missing items

    On April 30 you borrowed 'Room with a view'.
    We found the case and not the disk.

    Signed, your friends at EPL.
--snip--


== Danger level ==
This script can email all customers if you want so care should be taken to ensure that you have messaging right before mailing and your list is correct or customers will report spam. Also keep consistency. The script looks for pipe delimited input for all input files. If you use <code>user_keys</code> for customer IDs use them in all files. Failing to do so will result in the script not excluding customers because no matches will be found between <code>user_ids</code> and <code>user_keys</code>.

== Usage ==
This script can be run manually or run by [[cron]]

== Flags ==
 -c: Name of customer file, customers (one per line) will be notified if possible.
 -e: Name of exclude customer file list, customers (one per line) will NOT be notified.
 -n: Name of notice file whose contents will be sent to users.
 -x: This (help) message.

== Example ==

 mailerbot.pl -c customer.lst -n notice.txt -e exclude.lst >unmailed_customers.lst

== Input file examples ==
head customer.lst
21221012345678|Can you check if still have the disk for 'Room with a view'|
21221011111111|Did you forget to return 'Ironman II'?|
21221011111112|Did you forget to return 'Senna'?|
21221011111113|Did you forget to return 'The Mummy Returns'?|
116455|Did you forget to return 'Batman'?|

head notice.txt
subject:Missing items
Just a friendly reminder. We notice that you returned an item today but part of it was missing.
footer:Your friends at EPL!

head exlcude.lst
21221000000007
21221000000006
1237

head unmailed_customers.lst
21221000000007||

=== Notes on Notices ===
Notices follow these rules:
1 if the notice is missing the script exits.
2 if the notice is empty the script exits.
3 if the message body of a notice is empty the script exits.
4 both footer and subject may be empty but a warning will be issued if the subject is empty.

In general customer files can use formatting like this:
 subject: HOLD Cancellation Notice.
 Greetings!
 This is a message to let you know that the following holds have been cancelled.
 # A comment can be put in the file like this. The line must start with a '#' or it will be sent too.
 footer: Signed EPL (we share)
but the <code>footer: </code> and <code>subject: </code> tags can appear in any line order but must appear at the beginning of a line.

=== Customer files ===
The following is an example of a well formed customer file. All lines listed below are legal formats. Consecutive white space causes
formatting errors and is so is removed during processing, and does not appear in out-going messages.
 21221012345678|message one|message two|
 21221020902471|message|
 21221011111111
 21221019003992|The big sleep  Tom Wild Date 2014-05-05 | Phil Collins P.Collins April 21, 2014|

=== Exclude files ===
are used to exclude customers from the mailing process. Customer IDs or user keys must appear one-per-line, but may 
include additional information after the first pipe, it will be ignored.
