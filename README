Mailerbot is a project that emails customers messages.

It will mail all the customers whose bar codes are listed in the file denoted with -c.
It removes the customer bar codes found in -e (optional).
It then searches for customer emails and mails those it has addresses for
and prints those it can not to stdout.


== Danger level ==
This script can email all customers if you want so care should be taken to ensure that you have messaging right before mailing and your list is correct or customers will report spam. Also keep consistency. The script looks for pipe delimited input for all input files. If you use <code>user_keys</code> for customer IDs use them in all files. Failing to do so will result in the script not excluding customers because no matches will be found between <code>user_ids</code> and <code>user_keys</code>.

== Usage ==
This script can be run manually or run by [[cron]]

== Flags ==
 -c: Name of customer file, customers (one per line) will be notified if possible.
 -e: Name of exclude customer file list, customers (one per line) will NOT be notified.
 -n: Name of notice file whose contents will be sent to users.
 -x: This (help) message.

== Example ==

 mailerbot.pl -c test/customer.lst -n test/notice.txt -e test/exclude.lst >test/unmailed_customers.lst

== Input file examples ==
=== Notes on Notices ===
Notices follow these rules:
1 if the notice is missing the script exits.
2 if the notice is empty the script exits.
3 if the message body of a notice is empty the script exits.
4 both footer and subject may be empty but a warning will be issued if the subject is empty.

In general customer files can use formatting like this:
 subject: HOLD Cancellation Notice.
 Greetings!
 This is a message to let you know that the following holds have been cancelled.
 # A comment can be put in the file like this. The line must start with a '#' or it will be sent too.
 footer: Signed EPL (we share)
but the <code>footer: </code> and <code>subject: </code> tags can appear in any line order but must appear at the beginning of a line.

=== Customer files ===
The following is an example of a well formed customer file. All lines listed below are legal formats. Consecutive white space causes
formatting errors and is so is removed during processing, and does not appear in out-going messages.

=== Exclude files ===
are used to exclude customers from the mailing process. Customer IDs or user keys must appear one-per-line, but may 
include additional information after the first pipe, it will be ignored.
