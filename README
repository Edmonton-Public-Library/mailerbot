Project Notes
-------------
Mailerbot is a project that emails customers messages.

It will mail all the customers whose bar codes are listed with -c.
It removes the customer bar codes found in -e (optional).
It then searches for customer emails and mails those it has addresses for
and prints those it can not to stdout.

Instructions for Running:
./mailerbot.pl -c test/customer.lst -n test/notice.txt -e test/exclude.lst

Notes on Notices:
-----------------
Notices follow these rules:
1) if the notice is missing the script exists
2) if the notice is empty the script exits.
3) if the message body of a notice is empty the script exits.
4) both footer and subject may be empty but a warning will be issued if the subject is empty.

The basic format is...
=== snip ===
Hi there!
footer: Signed EPL (we share)
This is a test message.
Here is another line.
subject: HOLD Cancellation Notice.
=== snip ===
Note that the order of footer and subject doesn't matter. Also lines that start with '#' are considered comments
and are ignored.
